# operation-safeguard
A web application that gives you strong passwords

## Description
This webpage was designed as an easy interactive password generator for anyone who is in need of a quick strong password. The motivation for the webpage was to refactor an existing webpage that displayed all the content of a password generator but was not functioning. The added javascript syntax was added to the wepage to make the generator function properly. Several character requirments were added as window promts in order for the user to decide what they wanted their password to consist of. This allows the user to create a unique and diverse password.
